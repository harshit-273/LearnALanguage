|----------------------- Loops -----------------------|

- Infinite loop

    Syntax :-

    for {
        // some stuff to be executed again and again infinite times
    }

- Kind of while loop in other languages
    
    Syntax :-

    for condition {
        // some stuff to be executed till condition is satisfied
        // change in condition when required
    }

- The original "for" loop

    Syntax :-

    for initializing_value; terminating_condition; changes_made_in__initialized_value {
        // some stuff to be executed again and till changes_made would terminate the loop
    }

- Use of range in loop

    Syntax :-

    for index, element := range array_or_slice_maybe {
        /* some stuff to be executed again and again till in range,
            index is the index of array_or_slice_maybe and
            element is that element having that index */
    }
