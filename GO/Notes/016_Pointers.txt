|----------------------- Pointers -----------------------|

- Pointers are the something which store the value of address where the real value is stored.
- Using pointers we can change the value of something without touching that thing directly.

Syntax :-

    var someVariable *datatype = &otherVariable_ofType_datatype // assigning the value to a pointer

    *someVariable = otherValue_ofType_datatype // to access the value stored at the someVariable address
