|----------------------- Import more than one modules -----------------------|

import(
    "someThing",
    "otherThing",
    "anyThing"
)

- Variables declared in GO should be used. 
- To store a value in variable which will not be used later use "_" as variable name, it is an anonymous variable.
- Input is always taken in the string format.
- For printing something import "fmt".
- For working with input/output import "bufio".
- For working with standard input from OS import "os".
- For converting string to some other datatype import "strconv".
- Arithmetic Operations occurs between same datatypes only.
- Arithmetic Operations between two operands of some datatype gives the output as same datatype.
- Arithemetic Operator "/" when used divisor as 0(zero) throws an runtiime error.
- Conditional Operators can also be used with string datatype, string values would be compared on the basis of ASCII values.
- "break" keyword is used to break the loop and end loop.
- "continue" keyword is used to continue in the loop without proceeding the things after continue statment.
- For the arrays the size of the arrays should be defined.
- When an array is declared all it's elements are assigned the default value of datatype.
- Maps do not retain the order, they can just be used to store key-value pairs.
- Slices and Maps are actually the pointers to address where the real thing is stored.
    - when you assign one slice/map variable to another variable the values of those are copied to another variable
      i.e., address stored in the variable is assigned to another variable.
    - you can pass the slice or map to a function and process them but it is not required to return them.
