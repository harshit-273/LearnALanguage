----------------------------------------------- Comments -----------------------------------------------

- comments are something which will not be executed when the program is executed, but just used for the programmers note.
- in python single-line comments start with #(hash) and anything after that would be considered comment for that line
- multi-line comments are used to comment out the multiple lines, which can be any thing between pair of \'''(triple single quotes) or """(triple double quotes)

----------------------------------------------- Escape Sequence -----------------------------------------------

- escape sequence is something which can be used to specify that this is just the symbol not any operator or character used in the language
- in above comments part I have used \(backslash) for that triple single quotes are not the end of comment but to explain it's use
