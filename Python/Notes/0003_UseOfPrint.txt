-------------------------------------- Use of print function --------------------------------------

Syntax:-

    print("some \\thing", "anything", "other thing", end="sometext, by default it is \n")

- there would be space between every thing in double quotes due to ","(comma) except for the last "end"
- "end" at the last is used to specify how the print statement should end, by default it will add new line
- we can use any other object to print instead of the statements in the quotes
- we can use "\"(backslash) as escape character
